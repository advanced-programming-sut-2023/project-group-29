Faratin(){

    trade;
    empire factor,feed rate,... in general empire things;
    write test;

    move recovery questions to user model;
    handle own todos;
    handle menus;

    empire factor,feed rate,... in general empire things;
    add texture enum

    write test
}

jasbi(){

    complete unique functions for each building type;
    handle own todos;
    test for one of the procedures; --> faratin

}

abbasfar()
{
    pour oil, dig tunnel;
    create default maps;

    end turn:
