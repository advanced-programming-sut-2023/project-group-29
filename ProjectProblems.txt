for later:
    1.functions shouldn't be too long.
    2.check end of the game and condition of that
    3.set texture and drop building


Faratin(){

    add texture enum;
    trade;
    empire factor,feed rate,... in general empire things;
    write test;

    move recovery questions to user model;
    handle own todos;
}

jasbi(){
    complete enums in model;
    complete unique functions for each building type;

    handle own todos;
}

abbasfar()
{
    other things remaining for soldiers and weapons;
    {
        building hp decrease;
        condition that soldiers are on the wall and land soldiers attack wall;
    }
